These are the files required for loading a model trained for 100 epochs on the custom medical text dataset. 
The weights are extremely large (437MB) and cannot be uploaded on Github. Here is the link for the google drive folder-  https://drive.google.com/file/d/1meZygoJx6qd2UajzaFJn_NG05GuPKGTt/view?usp=share_link
Please download the weights into the folder and provide the path in the code.
